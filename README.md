## New Feature Workflow:
When developing a new feature, the following workflow should be followed:

1. Ensure that your local repository is up to date with this one. Run the command ```git pull``` in the main branch to check.
2. Create a new branch to work on the changes by using the command ```git checkout -b <ticket-name>```. Branches should follow the naming convention used on the team Jira.
3. Do all of the necessary coding and testing of the feature within this branch, using ```git add``` and ```git commit``` to save your progress.
4. Once the feature is complete and has been thoroughly tested, use ```git push``` to push these changes to this repository. You will likely need to set the upstream branch after running this command.
5. Go to GitHub and open a new pull request to merge the branch into the main branch. Write a title and description for the feature and assign a team member who did not work on the feature to review the changes. The pull request should be named with the following format: "branch: jira ticket name."
6. Once your pull request is approved the changes will be merged into the main branch.
